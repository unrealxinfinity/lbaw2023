        <h2> MineMax is a project management tool to help Minecraft players better organize their Worlds and Projects.</h2>
        <h2> Our mission is to help Minecraft players to better idealize and organize their projects and have a easy way to look back past the progress they've made. Knowing boredom out of not knowing what to do next is a major problem while playing Minecraft Survival, we seek to help people have more fun and stay enganged during gameplay!</h2>
        <h2> The team behind MineMax is composed of 4 students from the University of Porto: <a href="/contacts">Afonso Vaz Os√≥rio, Isabel Moutinho, Tiago Cruz, HaoChang Fu </a></p>
